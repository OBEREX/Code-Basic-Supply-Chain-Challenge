## Atliq Mart Supply Chain Analysis

### Problem
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

### Task:  
Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in the form of a comic.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

### Dataset Overview
1. None of the KPI targets were met, this might explain why customers are not renewing their contracts.
2. A significant drop in overall orders towards the end of the month of August 
### Recommendations
1. Ensure the Latest deliveries don't exceed 1 day.
2. Re-evaluate how delivery timelines are estimated in order to set realistic delivery timelines.
3. An overall improvement on "On Time" and "In Full" KPIs. "In Full" KPI can be addressed by making improvements on QA/QC in the manufacturing process to ensure orders are complete and also tracking of shipment and cargo transportation to ensure ordered products are complete before the transportation to customers or cities
